# GYM_PLUS


The gym management desktop application is an application designed to help gym owners and managers manage the day-to-day operations of their gym. The application allows gym owners and managers to manage gym equipment, trainers, and gym members.


One of the primary features of the gym management application is the ability to manage gym equipment. Gym owners and managers can add and remove equipment, assign equipment to specific areas of the gym, and track the status of equipment maintenance. The application can also generate alerts when equipment requires maintenance or repair.

Another feature of the gym management application is the ability to manage trainers. Gym owners and managers can add and remove trainers, assign trainers to specific classes, and track their schedules. 

The gym management application also allows gym owners and managers to manage gym members. Gym members can be registered in the application, and their personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address, can be stored. The application can also track gym member attendance, payments, and membership status. It can generate alerts when a member's membership is about to expire or when a member has missed too many sessions.

The application can also generate reports and statistics, such as membership growth, equipment usage, and trainer availability. These reports can help gym owners and managers make informed decisions about their gym's operations.
