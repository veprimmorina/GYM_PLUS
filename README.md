One of the primary features of the gym management application is the ability to manage gym equipment. Gym owners and managers can add and remove equipment, assign equipment to specific areas of the gym, and track the status of equipment maintenance. The application can also generate alerts when equipment requires maintenance or repair.

Another feature of the gym management application is the ability to manage trainers. Gym owners and managers can add and remove trainers, assign trainers to specific classes, and track their schedules. 

The gym management application also allows gym owners and managers to manage gym members. Gym members can be registered in the application, and their personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and email address, can be stored. The application can also track gym member attendance, payments, and membership status.
